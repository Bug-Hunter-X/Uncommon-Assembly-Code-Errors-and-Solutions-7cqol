# Uncommon Assembly Code Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates several uncommon but potentially serious errors that can occur in assembly language programming. These errors often involve memory management and address calculation.  The `bug.asm` file contains examples of the problematic code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides corrected versions with explanations.  These examples highlight the importance of careful memory handling in low-level programming.
